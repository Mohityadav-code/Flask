# Flask

## Overview

This repository contains code for a Flask application, with several APIs created and functional. The latest addition includes a 'Cart' functionality, implemented on May 21, 2023. The project is completely written in Python.

## Project Structure

The repository has several Python files, each dedicated to a particular feature of the application. Some of the key files include:

- `.vscode`: This file contains settings for the Visual Studio Code editor, useful for maintaining a consistent development environment.
- `__pycache__`: This directory contains Python byte code files which are automatically generated by Python, improving load-time performance.
- `AddToCart.py`: A Python script for adding items to a user's cart.
- `Cart.py`: This script handles operations related to the user's cart.
- `ClearCart.py`: This script allows clearing all items from a user's cart.
- `Create_Products.py`: A Python script for creating new products.
- `GetAllProducts.py`: This script fetches all available products.
- `GetCart.py`: A Python script that retrieves the current items in a user's cart.
- `Getting_A_single_Product.py`: A Python script to fetch details of a single product.
- `Order.py`: This script handles operations related to placing an order.
- `OrderBox.py`: A Python script related to the order box feature.
- `Products.py`: This script contains operations related to products.
- `Update_product.py`: A Python script that allows updating product details.
- `server.py`: The main server script for the Flask application.

Please note that each script needs to be understood in the context of the application, and should ideally not be used standalone.

## Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the directory containing the `server.py` file and execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python server.py
```

This will start the Flask server and you should be able to interact with the application via the defined APIs.
